&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h2> M-Way Tree </h2>

##### -> A M-Way Tree is a Data Structure that has multiple children
##### -> The way it stores the info is by keeping nodes and leaf and leafs are the nodes with no child.

##### -> To run it do the following steps :
```
user@localhost:~/$ git clone https://github.com/HarshitKhurana/DataStructures.git
user@localhost:~/$ cd DataStructures/Tree/M-Way\ Trees
user@localhost:~/DataStructures/Tree/M-Way Trees$ make install
user@localhost:~/DataStructures/Tree/M-Way Trees$ make run

```


##### -> The folder structure is as follows : 

|S.No| FileName                                  | Content                                                                 |

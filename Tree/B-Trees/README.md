&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h2> B- Tree </h2>

##### -> A B-Tree is a special kind of M-Way Tree where any node can have a maximum of only 2 children.
##### -> The children can be pointed via `left`  and `right` nodes.
##### -> The way it stores the info is by keeping nodes and leaf and leafs are the nodes with no child.

##### -> To run it do the following steps :
```
user@localhost:~/$ git clone https://github.com/HarshitKhurana/DataStructures.git
user@localhost:~/$ cd DataStructures/Tree/B-Trees
user@localhost:~/DataStructures/Tree/B-Trees$ make install
user@localhost:~/DataStructures/Tree/B-Trees$ make run

```

##### -> The folder structure is as follows :

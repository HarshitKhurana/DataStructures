&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h2> Priority Queue <-> Min/Max Heap </h2>

##### -> To simply put a Priority Queue is a simple queue that instead uses a factor which may or may not be the order of occurence for a node to calculate it's `priority`.
##### -> As soon as the nodes are pulled from this priority Queue, the nodes with highest priorities starts popping out.
##### -> Binary heap is used for the implementation of Priority Queue because it's the most efficient way.
##### -> To run it do the following steps :
```
user@localhost:~/$ git clone https://github.com/HarshitKhurana/DataStructures.git
user@localhost:~/$ cd DataStructures/PriorityQueue
user@localhost:~/DataStructures/PriorityQueue$ make install
user@localhost:~/DataStructures/PriorityQueue$ make run

```

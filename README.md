###### -> To run any code , follow as below :

```
user@localhost:~/$ git clone https://github.com/HarshitKhurana/DataStructures.git
user@localhost:~/$ cd DataStructures
# Here you can go to directory of your choice and run the following commands in order to run the code.
user@localhost:~/DataStructures$ make install

# Code Implementation 

###### -> Mostly the code will be in C++ and maybe in python too sometimes.
###### -> The respective folder will probably contain a document explaining the working as well as a working example  of that particula data structure.
###### -> To run any code , follow as below :

```
user@localhost:~/$ git clone https://github.com/HarshitKhurana/DataStructures.git
user@localhost:~/$ cd DataStructures
# Here you can go to diretory of yoour choice and run the following commands in order to run the code.
user@localhost:~/$ make install
user@localhost:~/$ make run

```

###### -> Data Structures are always selected based on the use-case i.e if you want top-most element only and not an entire sorted list it would be better to use a Heap (which returns top-most element in O(1)) rather than keeping a sorted list or BST which would take O(nlogN) for this operation.
